**`The Man who is on a Mission`**


I truly believe that epic things starts with a humble beginning, 
and thats exactly how my origin story of becoming a Software Engineer Began!
 As you embark on this new journey, undertand that the first few steps are usually 
the toughest ones. After walking for a while, you realized that things get 
easier over time. The same thing could be said about coding! Trust the journey! 
If you're about elevating yourself in all fields of human endeavor 
{% Mentally, Emotionally, Spiritually, Physically, and Financially %}, 
I would love to connect. Stay Bless!

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Baptiste's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive but dynamic individual who had extremely high hopes
 of creating the best projects in the world, after writing one line of code.
 And if you guess "Hello, World!", you guess correctly! After seeing literally magic happening
in front of my screen, I couldn't help but fathom to see where this may lead me, if I really gave it my all. So 
I decided to invest in myself, and landed a spot in one of the most Prestigeous Bootcamp out 
there, HackReactor. HackReactor is literally one of the top two Bootcamps out there, and it's NOT 
Number 2. Through the vigorous immersive program that lasted 19 weeks, I was prepared to enter 
out into the real world. I knew the ending of the Bootcamp was simply the beginning of a life 
long journey on being a student! This is my begining, and I am no where near my end. While I am 
on this meticulous journey call life, I will be looking for like-minded individuals to surround myself with,
is your work of place one of them?
